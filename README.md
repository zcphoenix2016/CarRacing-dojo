This is a world of heavy competition, no place for a weakness only the toughest can have a chance to join this race.
Best 6 are chosen ones which may proceed 
But the prize is worth it… wearing a shorts of a winner with carrots paintings on it! Losers have to wash it with their own hands.

You do not know the place, time or the weather you must be always ready.
In the meantime drivers take a part in other races so their cars may be not fully prepared, so they always keep their mechanics nearby, just in case.
But not everyone has the best quality mechanics there may be good/expert/ drunk.
Good one repairs before the race:
-Tire (20%)   // what does 20% mean, - it means, that in struct car (tires will have % of usability, he can repair 20% of it if it is less than 100%)
-Engine (30%)
-Suspension (15%)
Expert:
-Tire (35%)
-Engine (50%)
-Suspension (25%)
Drunk – he made a huge torch from the car it is broken. //drunk is better than expert, or worse than good ,
-Hmmm I would not feel comfortable driving a totally burned car :D you would be my hero if you could start one :D

Only fully restored cars in every aspect can join the race, but at least 2 of them have to join the race for it to take place at the arena.
The start order depends from Qualification Times for each car, every next place means additional 1 second.
Also there are 2 tracks and the cars may act differently depends on the circumstances.
Since for High quality engine(who with high quality engine) it takes 5s for 100m, low makes it in 6s.
- Car with high quality engine ;)
For good handling in the car every turn takes 0.5s, and for bad handling 1.5s.
First track: 500m and 6 turns. //what’s the speed for each car
(for a car with high quality engine the result for 500m would be 25s since he can travel 100m in 5s I made here a simplification since, you cannot go immediately with highest speed so it would be more like a graph of speed and acceleration)
Second track: 1000m and 3 turns.
For both tracks it takes 2 rounds to finish the race.

Also if the cars are going head to head the one with better engine goes another round 1s faster.
After 2 rounds if drivers has the same time score the one with better gear wins:
-Better handling // you mean operation ? (car with good handling/bad handling)
-Better engine
-Better mechanic
-Driver who had better qualification time gets the prize.
